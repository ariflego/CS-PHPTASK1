    <h1>Story 3: The Grocery Store</h1>

    <p>
      You opened the door and found yourself in a dark grocery store. The faint hum of fluorescent lights flickered overhead, casting long, 
      eerie shadows between the aisles. Shelves were stocked, but nothing looked quite right—cereal boxes were labeled with gibberish, fruits 
      were colors they shouldn't be, and the freezers seemed to breathe foggy sighs.  </p>
    <p>
      “Hey! Over here!” a frantic whisper cut through the silence. You turned to see a disheveled figure crouched near the canned goods aisle. 
      They were wearing a store uniform, but their name tag was smudged and unreadable.  </p>
    <p>
      “You've got to help me,” they said, eyes darting nervously toward the back of the store. “Something... strange is going on here. The manager? 
      Yeah, he's not exactly human anymore. I tried to leave, but the doors just loop me right back in. You're the first person I've seen in hours, 
      please, we need to fix this!”  </p>
    <p>
      The air grew colder, and the sound of footsteps echoed from the rear of the store. The figure grabbed your arm, desperation clear in their 
      voice. “What do you say? Are you in?”
