    <h1>Story 2: The Castle</h1>
    
    <p>
      You opened the door and found yourself in a dark castle corridor. The faint sound of distant music drifted through the halls, 
      accompanied by the soft rustle of tapestries swaying gently in the breeze. A golden candelabra flickered to life on its own, illuminating 
      the intricate carvings on the stone walls.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Ah, a visitor at last!” came a cheerful voice from the shadows. A young man in elegant robes emerged, his eyes sparkling with excitement. 
      “You've no idea how long we've been waiting for someone like you!”
    </p>
    <p>
      Before you could respond, the corridor seemed to brighten as more candles lit up, revealing a grand staircase spiraling upwards. The man 
      gestured dramatically, his grin widening. “The castle holds wonders you can't imagine. Come, let me show you the Great Library—or perhaps 
      you'd rather meet the enchanted musicians in the ballroom?”
    </p>
    <p>z
      Something about the place felt alive, humming with a quiet, welcoming magic. And despite the mysterious air, the castle seemed to beckon 
      you with warmth.
